Abstract
Background: Leishmaniasis is one of the neglected tropical diseases which is prevalent in the tropical regions of the
world most especially in Africa. It is caused by the Leishmania species and transmitted to humans majorly through
the bite of the female sandfy. This study was carried out in support of the continuous search for new drug molecules
efective enough for the treatment of leishmaniasis, and which have very limited side efects. This study was focused
on a combined 2-D and 3-D QSAR modeling of thirty-six arylimidamide-azole hybrids, molecular docking study,
design, and pharmacokinetic analysis of some selected and newly designed arylimidamide-azole analogs. The density
functional theory (DFT) with B3LYP and 6-31G** basis set was employed for the geometry optimization of the various
compounds. Genetic function approximation (GFA) and multi-linear regression (MLR) approaches were used for the
2-D QSAR model building, while the fractional factorial design (FFD) and uninformative variable elimination-partial
least square (UVEPLS) were employed for building the 3-D QSAR model. Pyridoxal kinase (PdxK) receptor (PDB: 6K91)
was the target protein of interest in this study.
Results: The built 2-D and 3-D QSAR models were found to satisfy the requirement of both internal and external
validation tests as follows: 2-D QSAR; R2=0.9614, R2
adj=0.9513, Q2
cv=0.9350, R2
test=0.6766 and cRp2=0.8779, and
for 3-D QSAR (UVEPLS at PC=5); R2=0.9839, Q2
LOO=0.7539 and Q2
LTO=0.7367. The CoMFA steric and electrostatic
feld contributions were 68.96% and 31.04%, respectively. All the designed analogs showed higher predicted activities than that of the template (36). Also, the new compounds showed higher binding afnities (MolDock scores) than
that of the reference drug pentamidine (−141.793 kcal/mol), with 36e showing the highest negative MolDock score
of −208.595 kcal/mol. Additionally, these newly designed compounds were said to be orally bioavailable (excluding
36f and 36g that violated 2 of the Lipinski’s provisions), with perfect intestinal absorption, less difcult to synthesize,
AMES toxicity free, and showed strong interactions with the target.
Conclusions: The newly designed compounds especially 36e have shown a marked pharmacological improvement
over the template molecule and are therefore recommended for further practical evaluation 
Background
Leishmania species is a group of protozoan parasites
responsible for leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease known to afect a global population of up to 350
million people majorly in the tropical regions (AlTamimia et  al. 2019; Baquedano et  al. 2016). Tree
common clinical manifestations were earlier reported
as cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) (Díaz et  al. 2019). Among these forms,
cutaneous is the most common, while VL is the most
fatal (Keurulainen et  al. 2018). Specifc species causing VL include Leishmania Donovani (L. donovani) and
L. infantum, transmitted by the insect vector (female
sandfy) (Ugbe et al. 2022a, b). Only a limited number
of drugs are readily available for the treatment of leishmaniasis such as pentamidine, amphotericin B, pentostam, paromomycin, and miltefosine, none of which is
reported free from associated drug adverse efects, low
efcacies, high cost, etc. (Fan et  al. 2018). For example, amphotericin B has been linked to fever, nephrotoxicity, myocarditis, chill, and hypokalemia (Ghorbani
and Farhoudi 2018). Induction of insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus has been the major drawback of
pentamidine, while paromomycin is not free from
nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity (Seifert 2011). Also,
most organisms had in recent times shown constant
resistance to some of these medicines, a case which
has greatly threatened the efective treatment of leishmaniasis (Fan et al. 2018). Additionally, the disease has
received less attention compared to other infections
such as hepatitis, malaria, AIDS, diabetes, tuberculosis, and cancer. As such, it has become imperative to
develop new medicines with attributes that overcome
all of these shortcomings.
In the continuous search for new efective drug compounds, in silico approaches like the molecular docking studies, quantitative structure–activity relationship
(QSAR), homology modeling, molecular dynamics,
and pharmacokinetics analysis among others play a
very crucial role because it is cost-efective, save time
and proves efective than the crude methods (Adeniji
et al. 2019; Ugbe et al. 2021). Te connection between
a compound’s structural properties (independent variables) and its biological activities (dependent variable)
is usually established by QSAR (Adeniji et  al. 2019).
Molecular docking on the other hand helps to investigate the binding of ligands with the active sites of the
target receptor (Ibrahim et al. 2020). Te pharmacokinetic study is a crucial step in the preclinical phase
of new drug molecules, which helps to ascertain how
such drug compounds afect the living organism when
administered (Lawal et  al. 2021; Ibrahim et  al. 2021).
Te choice of drug molecules for oral bioavailability has
been widely guided by the Lipinski rule of fve (RO5)
or the Pfzer rule which considers physicochemical
properties such as molecular weight (MW), lipophilicity, hydrogen bond donors (HBDs), and hydrogen bond
acceptors (HBAs) as necessary factors in predicting
drug’s likelihood of being orally bioavailable (Lipinski
et al. 2001). Also important for evaluation as part of a
pharmacokinetics study are absorption, distribution,
metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) (Ugbe
et al. 2022a, b).
Pyridoxal kinase (PdxK) from L. donovani (PDB:
6K91) is an interesting enzyme previously reported to
catalyze the phosphorylation of the 5′ hydroxyl group
of pyridoxal to form pyridoxal-5′-phosphate, an active
form of vitamin B6 (Are et al. 2020). PdxK is an important enzyme for parasite growth and key to host infection (Kumar et al. 2018). Chloroquine and primaquine
which are well-known anti-malaria drugs were earlier
reported to inhibit PdxK (Kimura et  al. 2018). Terefore, PdxK serves as a promising protein target for
designing new leishmanial inhibitors. Arylimidamideazole compounds incorporate both arylimidamide and
azole moiety in their structures, which were reported
to possess the advantage of interacting with the targets of both classes of compounds and which also show
improvement in the in  vivo pharmacokinetics and/
or pharmacodynamics of these classes of molecules

Hardware and software
Te hardware used was an HP laptop computer with the
following specifcations: Processor (Intel(R) Core(TM)
i5-4210U CPU @ 1.70  GHz 2.40  GHz), Installed
RAM (8.00  GB), System type (64-bit operating system,×64-based processor), Edition (Windows 10 Home
Single Language), Version 21H2.
Software used include ChemDraw Ultra v. 12.0.2,
Spartan’14 v. 1.1.4, PaDEL-descriptor v. 2.20, and Drug
Teoretics and Cheminformatics Laboratory (DTC-Lab)-
based software. Others include Material Studio v. 8.0,
Open3Dtools, Maestro v. 12.3, Biovia Discovery Studio
Visualizer v. 16.1.0.15350, and Molegro Virtual Docker v.
6.0, a product of the A CLC bio company.
Molecular geometry minimization
Te molecular structures of all the compounds were
drawn using the ChemDraw Ultra, saved as MDL molfle format, and thereafter imported separately onto the
Spartan’14 Graphical User Interface while enabling the
auto conversion of 2-D models to 3-D. Te imported
molecules were initially subjected to energy minimization and then saved in Spartan fle format. Te resulting
structures were then fully optimized frst by using molecular mechanics force feld (MMFF) and thereafter density
functional theory (DFT) with Becke’s three-parameter
read-Yang–Parr hybrid (B3LYP) option and utilizing the
6-31G** basis set. Te optimized structures were then
saved as SD fles and PDB formats for subsequent use in
descriptor generation and docking, respectively (Wang
et al. 2020; Ugbe et al. 2021).
2‑D QSAR model building
Te 2-D QSAR model building began with the generation
of molecular descriptors for all thirty-six compounds by
feeding the various molecules in SD fle format into the
PaDEL-Descriptor software (Lawal et al. 2021). Data pretreatment using the DTC-Lab pretreatment tool (GUI
1.2) was carried out to remove uninformative descriptors
from the generated descriptors pool (Adeniji et al. 2020).
With the aid of the DTC-Lab data division tool which
uses the Kennard Stone method, the resulting data were
then partitioned into a training set and test set data in the
70:30 ratio, respectively (Kennard and Stone 1969). Te
Material studio software was used for the model building
by employing the genetic function approximation (GFA)
to obtain the optimum descriptor combination which
is contained in the QSAR model equations built based
on the multi-linear regression (MLR) approach. MLR
establishes the relationship between the dependent variable (pIC50) and the independent variables (molecular
descriptors) (Arthur et al. 2020). Te MLR equation takes
the general form (Eq. 2) (Adawara et al. 2020):
where ‘k’s and ‘x’s are, respectively, regression coefcients
and independent variables, Y is the dependent variable,
and ‘C’ represents intercept or regression constant.
After the model building has been completed, the
next important step was to subject the built models to
an internal and external validation assessment. Some
parameters computed from the Material studio are useful for the internal validation such as correlation coeffcient (R2
), adjusted correlation coefcient (R2
adj), and
cross-validation coefcient (Q2
cv). Te Y-randomization
test was also necessary to show how well the model predicts the activities of the training set compounds (Adawara et al. 2020; Ugbe et al. 2021). To ascertain the built
model’s ability to predict the activities of the external test
set compounds, a validation assessment was carried out
externally. Te predictive strength of the QSAR model
depends heavily on the correlation coefcient (R2
 test)
for the external test set (Isyaku et al. 2020). Furthermore,
the Golbraikh and Tropsha acceptable QSAR model criteria were equally considered (Roy et  al. 2013; Edache
et  al. 2020a, b; Ugbe et  al. 2022a, b). Table 2 shows the
selected equations and parameters used for the validation
assessment.
Furthermore, the relative contribution of each descriptor in the built QSAR model is shown by the mean efect
(ME) values, defned as (Eq. 9):
where βj
 represents the coefcient j descriptor in the
model, Dj
 equals each descriptor’s value for each molecule in the training set, m represents the number of
descriptors present in the model, and n is the total number of compounds in the training set (Adeniji et al. 2019).
Te variance infation factor (VIF) defned as (Eq. 10)
shows the extent of inter-correlation between the
descriptors.
R2
 represents the coefcient of correlation of the multiple regressions between the variables in the model. VIF
equal to 1 shows that no inter-correlation exists for each
variable, and for VIF values within the range of 1–5, the
related model is acceptable, and where VIF is above 10,
the related model is unstable and therefore cannot be
accepted (Abdullahi et al. 2019).
Also, evaluating the applicability domain (AD) of a
QSAR model helps to ascertain the u

Model development (CoMFA)
Te aligned structures were used for building the 3-D
QSAR model using the Open3DQSAR software (Edache
et al. 2020a, b). 3-D QSAR can be comparative molecular feld analysis (CoMFA) concerned with only steric
and electrostatic felds’ contributions, or comparative
molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) which
deals with the steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen bond donor, and hydrogen bond acceptor felds’
contributions, among others (ElMchichi et  al. 2020).
Herein, the CoMFA model is studied. A dataset of 36
compounds was divided into a training set and a test
set of 25 and 11 molecules, respectively, i.e., percentage ratio of 70:30. Te steric and electrostatic molecular interaction felds (MIFs) analysis was carried out on
the aligned compounds placed within a 3-D cubic lattice
of grid size 1.5  Å and a 5.0  Å out gap (Tosco and Balle
2011). Variables pretreatment was carried out as follows:
energy cutof (30.0 kJ/mol), elimination of variables having constant or near-constant values, and standard deviation cutof (level=2.0) (Al-Attraqchi et  al. 2022). Te
fractional factorial design (FFDSEL) and uninformative
variable elimination-partial least square (UVE-PLS) were
used to develop the statistical models and to generate the
steric and electrostatic contour plots (Edache et al. 2022).
Te resulting models were then cross-validated using
the leave one out (LOO), leave two out (LTO), and leave
many out (LMO).
Molecular docking screening
A molecular docking simulation was conducted between
the thirty-six arylimidamide-azole analogs, the reference
drug (pentamidine), and the pyridoxal kinase (PdxK)
receptor (PDB: 6K91) using Molegro Virtual Docker
(MVD). PdxK in 3-D form was retrieved from the protein data bank and prepared on the Molegro Virtual
Docker by removing water molecules, ligands, and cofactors associated with the protein structure. Te software
allows for the repair (rebuild) of all afected residues. Te
receptor’s binding cavities were defned and that which
has the largest volume and surface (volume: 398.336 and
surface: 952.32) was adopted for the docking. All ligands
were imported in PDB fle format and prepared appropriately. Te simulation was carried out using the parameter
settings available in Table  3. Te predicted ligand–protein interaction profles were then visualized using the
Biovia Discovery Studio Visualizer. A similar method was
earlier reported elsewhere (Ibrahim et al. 2021; Abdullahi
et al. 2022).
Evaluation of pharmacokinetic properties
Te prediction of pharmacokinetic properties plays a
very critical role in the early stage of drug discovery.
Tis is because only molecules which demonstrate good
ADMET and drug-likeness properties reach the preclinical research phase (Ugbe et  al. 2022a, b). Terefore, six
arylimidamide-azole hybrids (21, 22, 26, 31, 33, and
36) with the highest anti-leishmanial activities were
subjected to drug-likeness and ADMET tests using two
online web servers; http://www.swissadme.ch/index.php
and http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/pkcsm, respectively.
Similar tests were performed on the newly designed
compounds (36a–36  g) to ascertain their drug-likeness
properties. Lipinski’s RO5 also called the Pfzer rule is a
well-established provision determining the oral bioavailability of a given compound (Lipinski et al. 2001; Lawal
et  al. 2021). Hence, the various compounds would be
subjected to the RO5 criterion to ascertain their oral
bioavailability.

Additionally, a plot showing the correlation between predicted and experimental activities for training and test
sets was obtained for both models and is presented in

Ligand‑based drug design (LBDD)
A total of seven compounds were designed using the
ligand-based drug design approach. A combined 2-D
and 3-D QSAR approach was adopted, where information provided by the 3-D QSAR (CoMFA) contour
maps was used for the design, while the inhibitory
activities of these new compounds were predicted using
the 2D-QSAR model equation. Teir molecular structures predicted activities and docking scores are presented in Table 13, while Table 14 shows their predicted
pharmacological interaction profles with PdxK. Also,
the binding interactions of these compounds (excluding
36f and 36 g) with the active sites of PdxK as visualized
via Biovia discovery studio are presented in Figs. 9, 10,

Discussion
2‑D QSAR modeling
Te values of VIF reported in Table  7 range from 1 to
5 for all 5 descriptors, indicating that the built QSAR
model was statistically substantial and is therefore stable and acceptable. Each descriptor has an absolute
t-statistics value of greater than 2, which shows that the
selected descriptors were signifcant (Adeniji et al. 2018).
Additionally, the calculated p values (Table  7) of these
descriptors in the model at a 95% confdence level were
less than 0.05. Tis is therefore in support of an alternative hypothesis that states that there is a relationship
between the descriptors in the model equation and the
compounds’ inhibitory activities at p ˂ 0.05.
Te strength and direction of each descriptor’s contributions in the built QSAR model are determined by the
value of the mean efect (ME) (Table 4). Te magnitude
of ME signifes the extent to which the descriptor infuences the molecule’s inhibitory activity, while the sign
of ME shows the direction of infuence. As shown in
Table 4, SpMin8_Bhv and AATS8p have the largest positive ME, which implies elevating their values will mean a
corresponding increase in the molecule’s inhibitory activities. ATSC3c, VR1_Dzv, and MDEC-22 on the other
hand have negative ME values, signifying that an increase
in these descriptors’ values will lead to a decrease in the
molecule’s antiproliferative activities.
Te application of GFA in conjunction with the MLR
approach led to the development of the 2-D QSAR model
with a total of fve descriptors as shown in Eq.  13. Te
built model was adjudged to satisfy the requirement of a
good QSAR model. Te low residual values between the
experimental and predicted activity values for both training and test set compounds as shown in Table 6 indicate
a high predictive strength of the built model. Te R2
 values of 0.9614 for the training set and 0.6766 for the test
set from Fig. 1 were similar to those obtained from GFA
(0.9615 and 0.6766) and MLRplusValidation analysis
(0.9615 and 0.6766) available in Table  5, which means
that the R2
 values were computed accurately. Figure  1
shows how well the predicted activities correlated with
the experimental activities as suggested by the grouping
of points along the line of best fts, implying that the built
model is very reliable and robust in predicting the activities of new chemical entities. A random distribution of
standard residuals on both sides of zero as observed in
Fig. 2 shows that the built model is not associated with
any systematic error.
Furthermore, the result of the Pearson correlation
analysis available in Table 7 shows that no pair of descriptors is signifcantly inter-correlated as suggested by the
low values of the correlation coefcients. Tis was also
observed by Adeniji et al. (2018).
Te values of R2
 and Q2
 obtained from the y-randomization test (Table  8) were signifcantly low, and
this implies that the developed model is stable, robust,
and reliable. Te Y-randomization coefcient, c R2
p
(0.877748) greater than 0.50, signifes that the built
model is powerful and not inferred by chance. Te pl
